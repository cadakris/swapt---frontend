Swap't

Swap't is an application that allows users to trade items in lieu of money. It is essentially an Ebay or Craigslist but instead of exchanging goods for money, you can Swap one of your items for another user's item. 

The application is not fully developed yet. At the moment there is no login and it is currently a one-sided / forced trade agreement (meaning there isn't anybody on the other side that is agreeing or disagreeing to the requested trade). However, a user is able to add an item, search for items, and request an item trade. 

I am hoping to continue to develop this app as I continue to learn more about React and Ruby. 

Enjoy!
